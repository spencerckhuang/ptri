## Objective: To create an accessible and informative visual that aids students in exploring classes they could take. To be achieved using a flow chart-style topologically-ordered diagram that shows what courses a student can take based on course prerequisites.

### Backend: SpringBoot API written in Java
- Utilizes Johns Hopkins SIS API to gather course data. After receiving, my backend parses this data for the parts that are most important, and also make the "prerequisite connections". 

### Frontend: (havent started yet but will probably be using React Flow to achieve visual effects)
